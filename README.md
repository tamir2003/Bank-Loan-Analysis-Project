**3. Trend Analysis**
-Monthly Loan Trends: Applications, Funded Amount, and Repayments over time
-State-wise Analysis: Loan applications and repayments across regions
-Term-wise Analysis: Distribution of 36 vs 60-month loans
-Employee Length: How employment stability affects loan applications and repayments
-Loan Purpose: Top reasons customers borrow money (debt consolidation, credit card, home improvement, etc.)
-Home Ownership Type: Loan distribution based on home ownership

**üìà Insights**
-Good Loans dominate the portfolio: More than 80% of loans are either fully paid or currently active.
-Bad Loans (Charged Off) still represent a significant risk, leading to losses in both funded and collected amounts.
-Loan Purposes: Debt consolidation and credit card refinancing are the top drivers of applications.
-High-Risk Segments: Borrowers with high DTI ratios and shorter employment history show higher default likelihood.
-Regional Trends: Certain states show higher default rates, signaling the need for localized risk assessment.
-Tenure Analysis: 60-month loans, while larger in funded amounts, carry higher risk of default compared to 36-month loans.

-Promote Good Loan Segments: Expand lending to segments with historically higher repayment performance.
-Portfolio Diversification: Avoid over-reliance on debt consolidation loans; encourage other loan purposes.
-Improve Recovery Strategy: Implement stronger recovery mechanisms for high-risk states/customers.
-Targeted Offers: Use customer segmentation to provide better loan terms for loyalty customers with strong repayment records.
