# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Project
To monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance I have created a comprehensive Bank Loan Report using Power BI. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends.
